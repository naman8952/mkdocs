## Docx class

### Purpose and responsibilities

#### Purpose

The primary purpose of the DOCX class is to encapsulate the critical functionality for processing documents within the Renix Document Processing API. It serves as a centralized component that handles the heavy lifting of document manipulation, analysis, and transformation tasks.

#### Responsibilities

1. **Document Initialization:** The `init_object()` method is likely responsible for initializing the DOCX object with the necessary parameters and configurations required for document processing tasks, such as request IDs, file paths, timestamps, and client IDs.
2. **Attribute Extraction:** The `file_to_attribute_extraction()` method handles the extraction of attributes or metadata from document files, such as PDF or Word documents.
3. **Document Slicing:** The `document_slicing()` method is responsible for slicing or dividing a document into smaller parts or sections.
4. **Document Deduplication (Document Level):** The `document_deduplication_doc()` method performs deduplication at the document level, identifying and removing duplicate documents from a set of documents.
5. **Document Deduplication (Page Level):** The `document_deduplication_page()` method performs deduplication at the page level within a document.
6. **File Upload Handling:** The DOCX class also includes methods with the "upload" prefix, such as `upload_file_to_attribute_extraction()`, `upload_document_slicing()`, `upload_document_deduplication_doc()`, and `upload_document_deduplication_page()`. These methods are specifically designed to handle document processing tasks for uploaded files, allowing the API to process documents directly from file uploads.
