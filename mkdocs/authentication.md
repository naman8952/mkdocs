## Authentication and Security:

The project implements authentication and security measures using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and various security-related components. Here's an explanation of the authentication and security mechanisms:

1. **Authentication:**
   - The `/login` endpoint is responsible for authenticating users.
   - When a user sends a POST request to `/login` with their email and password, the application checks if the provided credentials are valid by querying the `clientTable` in DynamoDB.
   - If the credentials are valid, the application generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) using the `create_access_token` function.
   - The JWT is signed with a secret key (`JWT_SECRET_KEY`) obtained from Azure Key Vault.
   - The generated JWT contains the client ID, email, and an expiration time (set using the `access_token_expire_hours` configuration).
   - The JWT is returned to the client as an `access_token` in the response.

2. **Authorization:**
   - Most routes require authentication and are protected by the `authenticate` dependency function.
   - The `authenticate` function expects an `Authorization` header in the request, containing a Bearer token (the JWT).
   - If the `Authorization` header is missing or invalid, the function raises an HTTPException with a 401 Unauthorized status code.
   - If the `Authorization` header is present, the function verifies the JWT using the `jwt.decode` function and the `JWT_SECRET_KEY`.
   - The function checks if the client ID and email in the JWT payload match the values stored in the `clientTable` in DynamoDB.
   - If the client ID and email are valid, the function creates a `TokenData` object containing the client ID, email, and client name, which is passed to the route handler.

3. **Security Components:**
   - **HTTPBearer:** The project uses the `HTTPBearer` class from FastAPI to handle Bearer token authentication.
   - **JWT:** The project uses the `jose` library for JSON Web Token (JWT) encoding and decoding.
   - **Azure Key Vault:** The project uses Azure Key Vault to securely store and retrieve sensitive data, such as the JWT secret key (`JWT_SECRET_KEY`).
   - **Rate Limiting:** The project implements rate limiting using the `slowapi` library and the `Limiter` class. The `@limiter.limit("20/minute")` decorator is used to limit the number of requests to 20 per minute per client.

4. **Security Best Practices:**
   - **Input Validation:** The project performs input validation for various routes to ensure that the required parameters are provided and meet the expected formats or conditions (e.g., file types, file sizes).
   - **Error Handling:** The project uses the `ErrorResponse` model to return detailed error information, including an error code, message, and trace, in case of exceptions or errors.
   - **Secure Communication:** Although not explicitly shown in the provided code, it is recommended to use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) when deploying the API to production environments.
